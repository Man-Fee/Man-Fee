- 👋 Hi, I’m @Man-Fee
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GO and Python and actual programming in C# and C++
- 💞️ I’m developing useful tools; e.g. a time clock program to log time at work or my greatest tool up to now: merchandise management system with an interface to a POS system and an order proposal system used by an unpacked shop (Unverpackt Laden)
- 📫 How to reach me => e-mail preferred
